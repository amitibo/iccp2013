abstract = {We report on the construction and calibration of a dual photoelastic-modulator (PEM)-based polarimetric camera operating at 660?nm. This camera is our first prototype for a multispectral system being developed for airborne and spaceborne remote sensing of atmospheric aerosols. The camera includes a dual-PEM assembly integrated into a three-element, low-polarization reflective telescope and provides both intensity and polarization imaging. A miniaturized focal-plane assembly consisting of spectral filters and patterned wire-grid polarizers provides wavelength and polarimetric selection. A custom push-broom detector array with specialized signal acquisition, readout, and processing electronics captures the radiometric and polarimetric information. Focal-plane polarizers at orientations of 0{\textdegree} and {\textminus}45{\textdegree} yield the normalized Stokes parameters q$=$Q/I and u$=$U/I respectively, which are then coregistered to obtain degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and angle of linear polarization. Laboratory test data, calibration results, and outdoor imagery acquired with the camera are presented. The results show that, over a wide range of DOLP, our challenging objective of uncertainty within {\textpm}0.005 has been achieved.},

abstract = {A dual-photoelastic-modulator- (PEM-) based spectropolarimetric camera concept is presented as an approach for global aerosol monitoring from space. The most challenging performance objective is to measure degree of linear polarization (DOLP) with an uncertainty of less than 0.5\% in multiple spectral bands, at moderately high spatial resolution, over a wide field of view, and for the duration of a multiyear mission. To achieve this, the tandem PEMs are operated as an electro-optic circular retardance modulator within a high-performance reflective imaging system. Operating the PEMs at slightly different resonant frequencies generates a beat signal that modulates the polarized component of the incident light at a much lower heterodyne frequency. The Stokes parameter ratioq$=$Q/I is obtained from measurements acquired from each pixel during a single frame, providing insensitivity to pixel responsivity drift and minimizing polarization artifacts that conventionally arise when this quantity is derived from differences in the signals from separate detectors. Similarly,u$=$U/I is obtained from a different pixel; q and u are then combined to form the DOLP. A detailed accuracy and tolerance analysis for this polarimeter is presented.},

	abstract = "<P></P>In translucent objects, light paths are affected by multiple scattering, which is polluting any observation. Confocal imaging reduces the influence of such global illumination effects by carefully focusing illumination and viewing rays from a large aperture to a specific location within the object volume. The selected light paths still contain some global scattering contributions, though. Descattering based on high frequency illumination serves the same purpose. It removes the global component from observed light paths. We demonstrate that confocal imaging and descattering are orthogonal and propose a novel descattering protocol that analyzes the light transport in a neighborhood of light transport paths. In combination with confocal imaging, our descattering method achieves optical sectioning in translucent media with higher contrast and better resolution.",

abstract = {A discussion is presented of daytime sky imaging and techniques that may be applied to the analysis of full-color sky images to infer cloud macrophysical properties. Descriptions of two different types of sky-imaging systems developed by the authors are presented, one of which has been developed into a commercially available instrument. Retrievals of fractional sky cover from automated processing methods are compared to human retrievals, both from direct observations and visual analyses of sky images. Although some uncertainty exists in fractional sky cover retrievals from sky images, this uncertainty is no greater than that attached to human observations for the commercially available sky-imager retrievals. Thus, the application of automatic digital image processing techniques on sky images is a useful method to complement, or even replace, traditional human observations of sky cover and, potentially, cloud type. Additionally, the possibilities for inferring other cloud},

  abstract={We present and discuss here the results of our work using MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) and MERIS (medium resolution imaging spectrometer) satellite data to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll- a (chl- a ) in reservoirs of the Dnieper River and the Sea of Azov, which are typical case II waters, i.e., turbid and productive. Our objective was to test the potential of satellite remote sensing as a tool for near-real-time monitoring of chl- a distribution in these water bodies. We tested the performance of a recently developed three-band model, and its special case, a two-band model, which use the reflectance at red and near-infrared wavelengths for the retrieval of chl- a concentration. The higher spatial resolution and the availability of a spectral band at around 708 nm with the MERIS data offered great promise for these models. We compared results from several different atmospheric correction procedures available for MODIS and MERIS data. No one particular procedure was consistently and systematically better than the rest. Nevertheless, even in the absence of a perfect atmospheric correction procedure, both the three-band and the two-band models showed promising results when compared with in situ chl- a measurements. The challenges and limitations involved in satellite remote monitoring of the chl- a distribution in turbid productive waters are discussed.}

abstract = {We present an approach for easily removing the effects of haze from passively acquired images. Our approach is based on the fact that usually the natural illuminating light scattered by atmospheric particles (airlight) is partially polarized. Optical filtering alone cannot remove the haze effects, except in restricted situations. Our method, however, stems from physics-based analysis that works under a wide range of atmospheric and viewing conditions, even if the polarization is low. The approach does not rely on specific scattering models such as Rayleigh scattering and does not rely on the knowledge of illumination directions. It can be used with as few as two images taken through a polarizer at different orientations. As a byproduct, the method yields a range map of the scene, which enables scene rendering as if imaged from different viewpoints. It also yields information about the atmospheric particles. We present experimental results of complete dehazing of outdoor scenes, in far-from-ideal conditions for polarization filtering. We obtain a great improvement of scene contrast and correction of color.},

The data for these projections were generated by a network of five automated scanning spectrometers, positioned on the flanks of the volcano. These measure slant-column amounts of SO2 at 105 different angles, every four minutes. Stable wind conditions allow the plume to be monitored on 82\% of days. A time-series of plume cross sections was computed, revealing the potential of this method to track variations in plume position and structure on timescales of minutes to hours, a result of potential importance for air traffic and civil defence in case of eruption, when copious amounts of fine ash can be transported.},

For satellite-derived and mooring comparisonsof apg(412), we found mean relative errors of -69.4\% (-67.1\%), -52.6\% (-48.9\%), and -62.7\% (-65.4\%) for the Arnone, GSM, and QAA algorithmsfor SeaWiFS (MODIS), respectively. Mean relative errors of 21.3\%, 19.9\%, and 16.5\% were found between SeaWiFS-derived (Arnone, GSM, and QAA algorithms, respectively) and moored bb(555) measurements. Discrepancies in Rrs at blue wavelengths are attributed to the satelliteatmospheric correction and sea surface variations of the mooredradiometers. High spatial and temporal variability of bio-optical propertiescoupled with differences in measurement techniques (pixel versus point)contribute to inconsistencies between remotely sensed and in situ biooptical properties.},
