\section{Introduction}

Two videos are submitted as supplementary material to the paper ``3Deflicker from Motion''. The video sequences are encoded using MPEG-4, H.264 video codec. Due to size limit, low resolution versions of the videos are attached. High resolution versions are available in the following link:\vspace{0.3cm}

\section{Stabilization.mp4}

This video demonstrates the principle of using stereo range maps for stabilization in dynamic spatio-temporal illumination, as detailed in Sec.~4. The video refers to Figs.~4-6.

\section{Structure\_Motion\_Deflicker\_Descatter.mp4}

This video demonstrates structure and motion estimation using stereo video sequences under dynamic illumination. Deflickering and descattering are also demonstrated for the underwater experiments. The video refers to Figs.~8,9,11.
